- Added the **DialogueOut** on Level 3 scene.

- Changed **movement input** to the robust **"input system"**.

- Tidied up the **designs** a bit inside **Main** scene with **extra buttons**!

- Turned the **"Player"** into a **prefab** for future **customization**

- Not implemented a connection to Firebase as of yet!

--**Latest Changes**--
- The game now totally runs Level 1 - 3

- Resolutions now **adjusts** according to **mobile** or **PC** screens

- **Roll backed** newly added **input system** *(since there was already one that I made ages ago... woops)*

- Tidied up the **designs** a bit inside **Main** scene with **extra buttons**! 2.0

- **Fixed** an issue where you can't be sent to the next levels (due to the build settingsâ€”the scenes weren't included in dawg!)

- I now have this game **built to my mobile**, which feels now playable and can be **showcased** at least!

<h3 align="left">== Things that was turned into a prefab ==</h3>
- Player
- Buttons
- UI

<h3 align="left">**== Remaining bugs ==**</h3>
- Somehow the speed of the player is slowest during Unity Editor testing (excluding the fact its speed stays consistent in a build version)

- At some point the interact buttons can be disabled permanently in one particular scenes due to triggering the collision of Elevators
